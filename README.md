## Routes - utils/routes.ts
- Route names are listed in types/global.d.ts
- Route configurations are listed in utils/routes.ts
- The default layout is layouts/default.ts
- Vue Router type overrides are written in typing.d.ts

## State Management - stores, types/stores.ts
- All states are stored under the stores directory.
- State types are stored in types/stores.ts, using namespaces for differentiation.

## Components - components, views
- Component Design:
  Independent, dependency-free components should be placed under the components directory and can be organized by page scope.
Components with dependencies should be placed under the views directory.

## Development Notes
Data that can only be fetched on the client should be wrapped with onMounted.
When passing parameters, maintain a single layer of communicationâ€”only parent-child interactions. Avoid skipping generations.
